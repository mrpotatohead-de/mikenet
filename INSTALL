To build the simulator, cd into the "src" directory and
follow the instructions in the INSTALL file there.

To build the demos, cd into the demos directory.  There
will be a subdirectory for each demo.  Once the simulator
has been built, you should be able to build each of the demos
by simply typing 'make' in each demo's subdirectory.
