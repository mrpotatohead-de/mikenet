How to install mikenet:

First, untar the distribution.  You'll end up with a directory called
Mikenet-{version}.  cd into that directory, and set your MIKENET_DIR
environment variable to that location.

For example, you'd do something like:

   uncompress Mikenet-v2.7.tar
   tar xvf Mikenet-v2.7.tar
   setenv MIKENET_DIR ~/Mikenet-v2.7

Put the setenv line at the bottom of your .cshrc file, if you use csh
or tcsh.  It allows the Makefiles in the demos to find the
libraries.

cd to the src subdirectory.  There is a Makefile there with
settings for various architectures.  See if your architecture is
listed in the Makefile.  If in doubt, "ansi" should work if you
have an ansi c compiler, or "gcc" if you have the gnu c compiler.

Now do a "make clean", followed by "make <target>", where <target>
is one of linux, gcc, cc, ansi, sparc, or hp.

It should build the simulator library.  Doing "make install" will
copy the simulator library over to the "lib" directory, and the header
files over to the "include" directory.  The subdirectory of the
"lib" dir will be whatever your ARCH environment variable is set to;
typical settings are things like i586, sparc, and such.  On many
systems, putting something like this in your .cshrc:

   setenv ARCH `arch`

will do the trick.  If you aren't on a heterogenous platform, then
don't worry about it.
