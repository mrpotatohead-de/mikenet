This is a benchmark for the new BLAS/ATLAS extensions to MikeNet.

Invoke the binaries with the "time" command and note the time it takes
to run, as in:

   time ./ps_vanilla

The Makefile will produce several binaries all from the same
source. Here's what they are:

ps_vanilla: A "vanilla" MikeNet, with no special blas extensions.

ps_atlas_sse: Using Atlas, compiled with the intel SSE extensions.

ps_atlas_PIII: Using Atlas tuned for a Pent III, *without* SSE extensions.

ps_atlas_native: Using a native blas implementation of 3dnow
                 extensions (if there is one.. Debian sometimes supplies
                 it).

ps_atlas_3dnow: Using Atlas tuned to that Athlon 3dnow extensions.



To see what ones to try, do:

    cat /proc/cpuinfo

and look at the "flags" field it kicks back. If it has sse, then try
the ps_atlas_sse binary. If it says 3dnow then try that one. If it
has both, try both. If neither, but is a Pent III, then try ps_atlas_PIII.
Compare all of them to ps_vanilla.  Here's some timings from our
500mhz Pent III (with sse).


ps_vanilla: 40 seconds

ps_atlas_PIII: 28.3 seconds

ps_atlas_sse: 17.7 seconds


On a 1.8ghz athlon with 3dnow and sse, we get:

ps_vanilla: 13.8 seconds

ps_atlas_PIII: 11.1 seconds

ps_atlas_sse: 8.9 seconds

ps_atlas_3dnow: 8.5 seconds

ps_atlas_native: 9.2 seconds

So on the Athlon we don't quite get the factor of 2 speedup that we see
on the Pent III.
